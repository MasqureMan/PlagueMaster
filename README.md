# PlagueMaster
Used for the PlagueMaster game

Langston Lewis: May 23, 2015

Hello, this is Langston Lewis' build of the game PlagueMaster.

You will need a program to unzip the zip file. I recommend 7zip. To run the game, you need to make sure the "PlagueMaster Final Build!" executable is in the same folder as the "PlagueMaster Final Build!_Data" folder.
If they are, just click the executable and it should play from there!
It was made in Unity 4.5.3f3. 

How to Play

Move: ASD or Arrow Keys
Attack: F
Fire Plague Bolt: G
Jump: Space Bar

The goal of the game is to get to the end of each level and touch the object 
there to get to the next. Each level is timed at just over a minute however, so speed 
is vital! The player will use their plague bolt projectile to get rid of turrets or
incoming projectiles they don't want to deal with and will use their movement to navigate
the obstacles. Shooting plague bolts consumes energy. Attacking doesn't kill turrets, but will destroy projectiles to restore health 
and restores energy when used on turrets. It is useful for difficult situations or when you
just need another couple of bolts. Be careful though, as the player's health isn't very high
and getting close to turrets is risky!

I have pulled down and verified that the project is complete and runs as
I designed it.
